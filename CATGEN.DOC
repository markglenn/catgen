  1) What is CatGen v3.0?
     ---------------------
     CatGen v3.0 is a program that takes your TEXT files and converts them
  into self running file viewers.  Not only that, but it is in color. 
  Believe it or not, this file was created with CatGen v3.0.  It's
  capabilities are outrages.  It has absolutely no flicker and has incredible
  speed.  It is based on 25x80 screen size and will look quite weird in 50x80.
  It has scrolling features that will be used by using the up, down, PGUP, PGDN
  keys.  The best feature though is that you can distribute your file.

    2) What is included?
     -----------------
     CatGen comes with 9 files
      1: CATGEN.EXE   - The catalog generator
      2: CATDOC.BAS   - This file source code
      3: CATDOC.EXE   - This file
      4: CATGEN.DOC   - This file in TEXT format
      5: ORDER.FRM    - Order and Registration file for other programs
      6: FILE_ID.DIZ  - File Info
      7: CATALOG.EXE  - Catalog for Inventive Software
      8: ANSI2CAT.EXE - Ansi converter
      9: FONTSET.TXT  - ASCII Fonts

  3) Command line perimeters
     -----------------------
     There really is only one command line perimeter.
       : CatGen Infile.ext (Outfile.ext)
        The Infile.exe must be include.  Outfile.ext is something that is
        optional.  If you decide not to use this, it will output to CAT1.OUT.

  4) What is it doing while running?
     -------------------------------
     It does multiple things.  It first creates a temp file called TEMP1.TMP
  that holds your DOC with the DATA statements in front of it.  Then it goes
  in and loads all the BASIC statements to run it.  A file is created called
  (filename) and you have a finished product ready to compile.

  5) How does it do all this?
     ------------------------
     It takes your file and process it and creates BASIC text.  Take a look at
  the file sometime and see how it is really done.

  6) I've run it, now what?
     ----------------------
     Okay, you have created your file and now it is time to modify.  Look at
  Chapter 8 for that.  Chapter 7 shows how to change the color of each line.
  After that, you want to compile it.  Load the program into QB by typing this:
    QB filename /L QB.QLB   or
    QBASIC filename
  Now go to run and compile.  Make it Stand Alone EXE and click on Make EXE
  and Exit.  If you only have qbasic, do the following.  Create a file called
  filename.BAT and edit it.
  @ECHO OFF
  QBASIC filename /RUN
  
  7) Color
     -----
     Wow, I can change color?  Yep, you can.  If you look at the end, you will
  see that is says the DATA statement and then the numbers '03'.  This is the
  color that it changes it all to.  You can change this number to anything.
  It must be two digits long like:  03 or C5.  In 2.0, the numbers were
  changed to hex so you can now do backgrounds.  The colors are as following:
  00) BLACK       08) GREY             10) BLACK ON BLUE
  01) BLUE        09) LIGHT BLUE       FF) BRIGHT WHITE ON WHITE
  02) GREEN       0A) LIGHT GREEN
  03) CYAN        0B) LIGHT CYAN
  04) RED         0C) LIGHT RED
  05) MAGENTA     0D) LIGHT MAGENTA
  06) BROWN       0E) YELLOW
  07) WHITE       0F) BRIGHT WHITE

  8) Modifying
     ---------
     For people who want to make a big logo on the doc, I included a ANSI to
  CATGEN converter.  All you do is add it to your doc and it will look exactly
  like the ansi file.  (Sorry, no animations and only 25 lines long).

    Also, you can add buttons and lines:
    þBUTTON0001
    CHR$(254) + BUTTON0001  (4 digit line number)
    þLINE1
    CHR$(254) + LINE1 (1 digit line type)

  9) How do I use the actual compiled work?
     --------------------------------------
     Well, you first run the program.  You see the file and information at the
  bottom.  You use the arrow keys or the PGUP or PGDN key.  These move the DOC
  up or down.  The new feature is the "S" feature.  It searches the file for
  whatever you want.

 10) Final Touches
     -------------
     Since I don't really know any final touches, but all great DOCs have this
   area.  You can modify the generated file all you want.  The generated viewer
   is freeware and maybe modified and distributed without permission.  Think of
   it as your program you and only you made.

  A) Trouble Shooting
     ----------------
     1) While compiling, it says an out of memory error
       A:Try freeing more memory.  If you don't want to do this, if you look
          at the begining of the file, it shows DIM statements.  Change this
          to the length of your file.  If you don't know the length, look at
          the first DATA statement.  It will say something like this:
           DATA 253
          Change the DIM statements to:
           DIM text$(255) 'add 2 just in case
           DIM ColorVal(255) 'add 2 just in case
           You shouln't have to do this because it is automatic now.
     2) While compiling, it says an error
       A:Try trouble shooting it.  If that doesn't work, re-generate the file.
          if that still doesn't work, contact me about it.
     3) Doesn't generate
       A:You have a corrupted CatGen v3.0.  Please reinstall.  You may also
          have a bad output file.  DOS only allows certain characters in
          filenames.  Try a filename with only letters:
           CATGEN MY.DOC MYDOC.BAS
     4) Bombs
       A:You have a corrupted CatGen v3.0.  Please reinstall.
     5) Subscript out of range
       A:Your file is more than your memory can handle.  Cut it down.
     6) Unexpected error, please recompile
       A:For some odd reason, your DOC got edited so it can not be used.  You
         might have edited it and messed it up.  If you know what you are
         doing, take out the ON ERROR statement and try to debug it.  If not,
         re compile it.  If the same error occurs, contact me.
     7) I lost my cursor.
       A:When the Help is invoked, it turns off the cursor.  It doesn't just
         disappear.  Just turn it back on:
         LOCATE , , 1, 7, 8
     8) I don't have a mouse and start-up is sooo slow.
        You can easily turn off the mouse.  Look for the lines that say
        >>>>>> START HERE <<<<<<
     9) I edit the basic file and it doesn't have any "'s in the DOC.  How
        do I add them?
       A:Well, since DATA statements are surrounded by "'s, all "'s in your
         DOC were converted to character 255's.  To add "'s, go to the 
         position where you want them and hold down ALT.  Then press 255 on the
         key pad and let go of ALT.  It is an invisible character, but it is 
         there.

  B) Upcoming Features
     -----------------
        Editor
        Multicolored search

  C) Features of Each Version
     ------------------------
      v1.0b - The first official version.  Never distributed.

      v1.0 - Added color feature.  PGUP and PGDN keys added.  Fixed
             Arrow key bug.  Finally distributed

      v1.1 - Search feature added.  Also added the ON ERROR function so
             (Just in case) if it has an error it won't show that ugly error
             screen.  Added the registration file(oops, sorry to everyone
             with version 1.0).

      v1.2 - Added 'S' at the bottom.  Fixed the scrolling up one line on
             search bug.  Fixed bottom text on no search bug.  Man did I have
             more trouble with that search feature than anything else.  Mainly
             a bug fix version.

      v1.3 - This would have been the one with EMS support but found it would
             only work in QuickBasic without rewriting the whole code.  Maybe
             later.

      v1.4 - Added online help support.  With this new option, you won't see
             all the ugly code because it has been put in SUBS.  Also I added
             a change in the DIM statements.  No need to change them this time
             because it automaticly changes them.  Also added limited edition
             source code.

      v2.0 - Limited edition source code taken away because of people without
             respect.  Scrolls sideways.  Multiple colored lines.  Background
             colors.  Improved search.  Now only supports HELP programs 
             because the two options were identical except HELP was cleaner.

      v3.0 - New and improved version.  CatGen is now 15x faster, cleaner code
             and mouse/scroll bar/buttons.  Also includes preprogrammed lines
             and buttons to press.  Better search, ANSI converter, and ASCII
             fonts document.
